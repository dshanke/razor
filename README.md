# razor

assignment work - creating a new repo and working with git for the first time


Assumptions:

- will be comiled on windows with VS 2013 (visual studio solution)
- should be easily portable
- am not using C++11 and above features

- Not exactly following the TDD approach but will use google test framework to drive my developement
- if time permits will use doxygen
- the src for 3rd party components will not be included and will only use the pre compiled binaries and headers
